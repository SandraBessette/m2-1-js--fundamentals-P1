# Fundamentals: JavaScript Types

There are 6 basic types in JavaScript.

- Booleans
- Numbers
- Empty values
- Strings
- Arrays
- Objects

## Booleans

Boolean values are either `true` or `false`. (written as such without any quotation marks `"`)

```js
true;
false;
```

---

## Numbers

Numbers are exactly what you would expect them to be: numeric values.

- They are numeric values.
  - `19`
- They can be fractional.
  - `12.75`
  - `2.998e8`
- Calculations with integers will always be precise, but this is not quite true for fractional numbers.

---

## Empty values

There are two special values, written `null` and `undefined`, that are used to denote the absence of a meaningful value.

They are themselves values, but they carry no information.

> "The difference in meaning between `undefined` and `null` is an accident of JavaScript‚Äôs design, and it doesn‚Äôt matter most of the time. In cases where you actually have to concern yourself with these values, I recommend treating them as mostly interchangeable." (Marijn Haverbeke, [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/01_values.html))

---

## Strings

Strings represent text. They are written/defined by wrapping the text in quotes.

- Double quotes: "Your path you must decide."
- Single quotes: 'Luminous beings are we‚Ä¶not this crude matter.'
- Backticks: \`Do. Or do not. There is no try.\`

They are equally good... sort of.

### Backticks \`\`

- Strings wrapped in backticks have a super power called, **interpolation**.
- Interpolation is a way of inserting JavaScript into your strings.
- To interpolate a string you use this syntax \${}

#### Interpolation Example

```js
let pi = 3.14;
let diameter = 30;
let radius = diameter / 2;

// declare a string
let introduction = `The area of a circle is œÄr¬≤.`;

// declare a string with interpolation
let example = `A ${diameter}cm pizza has an area of ${
  pi * radius * radius
}cm¬≤.`;

// Concatenate the strings
let text = introduction + ' ' + example;

console.log(text);
```

---

## Arrays

- An array contains multiple values, of pretty much any type.
- Arrays are sequences of anything. Strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, other things we haven't learned about yet.
- You can declare an array by using [ ] square brackets.
- We separate the elements of an array with a comma.
- Arrays are mutable.

```js
['bacon', undefined, 900, true];
```

---

### Accessing the values in an array

We reference the element of an array by its position (index) in the array.

‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è Indexing starts at 0 ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è

```js
// Example 1 - Given this array
let anArrayOfNumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
```

1. `anArrayOfNumbers[0]` is `1`
2. `anArrayOfNumbers[5]` is `6`
3. `anArrayOfNumbers[9]` is `10`
4. `anArrayOfNumbers[10]` is `undefined`

---

‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è Indexing starts at 0 ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è

```js
// Example 2 - Given this array
let anArray = ['bacon', undefined, 900, true];
```

1. How do we access the value `900`? anArray[2]
2. How do we access the value `true`? anArray[3]

Arrays can be nested in arrays. Arrays can contain arrays that contain arrays that contain arrays that... _you get the idea_

‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è Indexing starts at 0 ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è

```js
// Example 3 - Given this array
let table = [
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12],
  [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18],
  [19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24],
  [25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30],
  [31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36],
];
```

What is the value of the following?

1. What is the value of `table[0][0]`? 1
2. What is the value of `table[5][5]`? 36
3. What is the value of `table[2][3]`? 16
4. How would we access the value `27`? table[4][2]

---

## Objects

Very broadly, an object can be defined as an unordered collection of key/value pairs.

`{'givenName': 'Yoda', 'surname': undefined, 'age': 900}`

This object has 3 properties.

- It has a property with name `givenName` and value of `'Yoda'` of type string.
- It has a property with name `surname` and value of `undefined` of type empty value.
- It has a property with name `age` and value of `900` of type number.

### Accessing values in objects

Values in objects can be accessed with

- dot notation
- bracket notation

```js
// Example
let person = { name: 'Bob', age: 23 };
const otherPerson = { name: 'Joe', age: 31, height: '170cm' };
```

- `person.name` is 'Bob'
- `person['name']` is 'Bob'
- `otherPerson.age` is 31
- `otherPerson['age']` is 31

---

## Truthy and Falsy

As well as a type, each value also has an inherent boolean value, generally known as either _truthy_ or _falsy_.

The following values are ALWAYS _falsy_:

- `false`
- `0` (zero)
- '' or "" (empty string)
- `null`
- `undefined`
- `NaN`

EVERYTHING else is _truthy_. Everything else.

- '0' (a string)
- 'false' (the word false as a string)
- `[]` (an empty array) _more on arrays in a bit_
- `{}` (an empty object) _more on objects in a bit_
- `function() {}` (an empty function) _more on functions in a bit_

## Exceptions, special cases and just-plain-annoying side-effects

- `Infinity` and `-Infinity`
- `NaN` stands for "Not a number" even though it has itself a value of type "number" ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- `NaN` is not equivalent to anything ‚Äì including another `NaN`!
- Automatic type conversion üò≤

```js
// Examples of type conversion
8 * null; // equals 0
'5' - 1; // equals 4
'5' + 1; // equals 51
```
